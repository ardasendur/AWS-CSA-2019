Here is a list of important information about EBS Volumes:
- When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated
within that zone to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.
- An EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.
- After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone
- An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance.
You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance creation.
- EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production 
which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
- Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)
- EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.
 - You should use SNS instead of SES (Simple Email Service) when you want to monitor your EC2 instances.
 - You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.
 - Multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over the same IP address.
 - Classic load balancer does not support SNI but application load balancer support SNI.
 - ALB or  Cloud Front web distribution to allow SNI feature.
 - You only need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when your client 
 web application on one domain interacts with the resources in a different domain.
 - When it's is runnig (hot attach) (ENI)
 - When it is stopping (warm attach) (ENI)
 - When the instance is being launched (cold attach) (ENI)
 - Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:Lambda,SNS,SQS
 - Amazon Cognito service is primarily used for user authentication and not for providing access to your AWS resources
 - STS has the ability to provide temporary security credentials.
 - AWS shared respobsilibities : compute,storage,databse,networking,regions,edge location,AZ
 - Customer responsibilities : customer data,OS,platform,application, IAM
 - VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own network.AWS support IPsec VPN connection.
 - You don't need a NAT instance for you to be able to create a VPN connection.
 - Massively parallel query execution and columnar storage - redshift
 - you the ability to store huge amounts of data and perform quick and flexible queries on it -redshift
 - Warm standby DR is a meyhod of redudancy in which the scaled down secondary system in the background of the primary system.
 - Using an Elastic Load Balancer is an ideal solution for adding elasticity to your application.
 - When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, 
 which is in turn promoted to become the new primary. 
 - Default NACL : inbound: allow, outbound :allow
 - Custom NACL : inbound : deny, outbound: deny
 - Amazon S3 offers a highly durable, scalable, and secure destination for backing up and archiving your critical data.
