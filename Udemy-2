Here is a list of important information about EBS Volumes:
- When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated
within that zone to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.
- An EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.
- After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone
- An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance.
You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance creation.
- EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production 
which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.
- Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)
- EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.
 - You should use SNS instead of SES (Simple Email Service) when you want to monitor your EC2 instances.
 - You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.
 - Multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over the same IP address.
 - Classic load balancer does not support SNI but application load balancer support SNI.
 - ALB or  Cloud Front web distribution to allow SNI feature.
 - You only need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) when your client 
 web application on one domain interacts with the resources in a different domain.
 - When it's is runnig (hot attach) (ENI)
 - When it is stopping (warm attach) (ENI)
 - When the instance is being launched (cold attach) (ENI)
 - Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:Lambda,SNS,SQS
 - Amazon Cognito service is primarily used for user authentication and not for providing access to your AWS resources
 - STS has the ability to provide temporary security credentials.
 - AWS shared respobsilibities : compute,storage,databse,networking,regions,edge location,AZ
 - Customer responsibilities : customer data,OS,platform,application, IAM
 - VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own network.AWS support IPsec VPN connection.
 - You don't need a NAT instance for you to be able to create a VPN connection.
 - Massively parallel query execution and columnar storage - redshift
 - you the ability to store huge amounts of data and perform quick and flexible queries on it -redshift
 - Warm standby DR is a meyhod of redudancy in which the scaled down secondary system in the background of the primary system.
 - Using an Elastic Load Balancer is an ideal solution for adding elasticity to your application.
 - When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, 
 which is in turn promoted to become the new primary. 
 - Default NACL : inbound: allow, outbound :allow
 - Custom NACL : inbound : deny, outbound: deny
 - Amazon S3 offers a highly durable, scalable, and secure destination for backing up and archiving your critical data.
 - Failover is automatically handled by Amazon RDS so that you can resume database operations as quickly as possible without administrative intervention. When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the canonical name record (CNAME) in Route53 for your DB instance to point at the standby, 
 which in turn is promoted to become the new primary.
- Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.
- Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency.
- Real time streaming data - >Kinesis
- Amazon RDS DB instances enhanced monitoring : RDS provides metrics in real time for the OS that your DN instaces runs on.
- Enhanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance use the CPU.
  (RDS child processes,RDS process, OS process)
  - SSL/TLS certifacte import - AWS Certificate Manager ,IAM certificate store
  - If you got your certificate from a third-party CA, import the certificate into ACM or upload it to the IAM certificate store.
  - AWS x-ray to trace and analyze your user requests as they travel through your Amazon gateway API
  - X-Ray gives you an end-to-end view of an entire request, so you can analyze latencies in your APIs and their backend services
  - CloudTrail is primarily used for API logging of all of your AWS resources.
  - VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your entire VPC.
  -  A virtually unlimited amount of object data without any effort to scale when demand unexpectedly increases - S3
  -  By default, each workflow execution can run for a maximum of 1 year in Amazon SWF
  - status is insufficient-data, the checks may still be in progress on the volume (EBS)
  - If all checks pass, the status of the volume is ok (EBS)
  - EMR does not provide the ability to process your data in real-time, unlike Kinesis
  - S3 ACL are primarily used to grant basic read/write permissions to AWS accounts not suitable for providing access over the Internet.
  - S3 bucket policy is sutiable for readin publicly all over the Internet
