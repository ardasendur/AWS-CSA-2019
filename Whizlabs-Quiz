- To automatically trigger pipeline with changes in the source S3 bucket, amazon Cloud Watch Events rule & Aws Cloud trail must be applied.
 when there are is a change in S3 bucket , events are filtered using AWS Cloud Watch events are used to trigger the start of pipeline.
 (Webhooks are used to trigger pipeline when the source  is Github repository)
- Placement group is used for low latency access between EC2 instances.
- VPN Connections provides data is encrypted in transit network between VPC and on -premise .
- AWS Direct connect does not provide encrypted traffic in connections between AWS VPC and On-premises network.
- AWS VPC peering support accross different region.
- CloudHSM is a cloud based hardware security module.
- CloudHSM enables you to easily generate and use your own encrption keys on the AWS Cloud.
- To enable access to from internet for instance in  a VPC subnet
  - > Attach internet gw to ypur VPC
  - > Ensure that subnet  route table points to the IGW
  - > Ensure that instance have a globally uniqiue Ip Address (public ipv4, Elastic Ip)
- Default NACL rules will allow all traffic.  
- AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation.
- Lambda@Edge to run costum code close to ypur viewer.
- Hosted Zone is a container for records.A hosted zone and the correspondig domain have the same name. We have two type of hosted zones.
  public hosted zone: contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet.
  private hosted zone: route traffic in an Amazon VPC.
- An alias record contains a pointer to AWS resources such as CF or amazon S3 bucket.
- Network Load Balancer can be used to terminate TLs connections instead of back end instance reducing load on instance.
- When you create a TLS listener, you must select a security policy.
- NLB does not support custom security policy.
- When an EC2 instances is in Hibernate state(suspend-to-disk), you can pay only for the EBS volumes and Elastic Ip addressess attacthed to it.
- When you hibarnate an instance , Hibarnation saves the content from the memory(RAM) to Amazon EBs snapshot. 
- The hibernation freezes all of the processes,saves the content of the RAM to the EBS root volume and performs regular shutdown.
- EBS volume takes snapshot then create  new volume in other AZ
- IAM roles are designed to make application securely API calls.
- ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and Ec2 launch type.
- You can back up data on Amazon EBS volumes to amazon s3 by taking point-in -time snaphots.Snapshots are incremental backups.
   Incremental backups means only the blocks on the device that have changed after most recent snapshot are saved. Aim of incremental backup
   is to prevent store duplicating data.
- Snapshots need to be available in another region for disaster recovery purpose.
- Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager can be used for creation,retention & deletion of EBS snapshots.
- To get private and public Ip  of Ec2 instance http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
- Cluster placement group are recommended for app that benefits from low latency, high network throughput.
- When EC2 runnig tt ohibernate state, there is no change in Private IPv4 & IPv6. Change in public ipv4 and ipv6.
- AWS recommeds that for small workloads Genereal purpose SSD volume 
- No longer have to randomize prefix for naming for performance and can use sequential data-based naming for prefix for object.
- If you need low latency access to your entire dataset, first configure your on-premises gateway to store all yor data locally.
- Stored volume : if you need low-latency access to your entire data set. First configure your on-premises gateway to store all your data locally.
- Cached volume : cached volumes offer low-latency access to your frequently accessed data.
- To provide secure access for redis  cluster : redis AUTH mus be enabled.
- For Redis auth, clusters must be enabled with in-transit encryption during initial deployment, not at rest  encryption.
- Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect ,process and analyze real-time ,streaming data.
- Redshift cluster : support cross-region snapshots for disaster recovery.
- EBS Volumes are replicated within their Availability zones.
