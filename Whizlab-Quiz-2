- The Web servers can be in the Private subnet since the communication between instance and ELB happens via the private IP.
    this approach provides better security for the Web Server.
- There is no requirement for ec2 instance to be in public subnet as route 53 route the request to elb whose endpoint is exposed lb is in 
public subnet and the communication between elb and ec2 instance happen via private ip (better security purpose)
- Consolidate Billing combines the usage of all Accounts within organizations & shares Reserved Instances between multiple accounts.
- Reserved Instance to be used by other accounts in the same organizations.Instance should be launched in the same A-Z and should not be
part of same VPC.
- AWS CodePipeline can be used to automate the release process for building ,testing and deploying code based on the release process model.
- Launch Amazon RDS instance outside AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment storing the connection string in S3 bucket.
- CodeCommit: Service where you store the code (Similar Github)
- CodeBuild: build and testing service in your CICD
- CodeDeploy: deploy and packaged code oto EC2 and AWS Lambda
- SSO (Single Sign On)
- Step Functions: Coordinate Lambda functions and ECS containers into workflow.
- Glue: ETL service on AWS
- Workspaces: Virtual desktop  demand in the cloud.
- AWS Config: Config continiously monitor and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation 
of recored configuration agaisnt desired configuration..
- Direct connection guarantees great performance and security ( as the connection private)
- Lambda timeout after 15 minutes.
- Network Load Balancer expose a fixed IP to the public web. Appication and CLB exposed fixed DNS(=URL) 
- To generate pre-signed URL  we must code , and Lambda is the perfect tool for running that code on the fly.
- With SSE-C, client provide encrption key but let AWS do the encrption.
- Path based and host based roting only available for ALB
- Neptune -graph database.
