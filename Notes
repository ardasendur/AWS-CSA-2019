-	For objects larger than 100 MB use multipart upload. 
-	Amazon SQS has short polling as a default. Does not wait for messages to appear in the queue.
-	Amazon SQS long polling uses fewer request and reduces to cost. Eliminates false empty response by querying all servers. 
SQS wait until a message is available in the queue before sending a response. 
-	Default security group have allow rules.
-	Custom security group does not have inbound allow rules.(All inbound traffic is denied by default)
-	All outbound traffic is allowed in custom and default security group.
-	Direct Connect is used for connecting on-premise data centers into AWS using private network connection.
-	If you are installing MySQL on an EC2 instance you cannot enable read replica or multi-AZ.  
-	In general , when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should use multipart upload instead of uploading the object a single operation. The largest object size can be uploaded a single put is 5 GB.
-	Aurora DB can scale up 64 TB and Aurora replicas features milliseconds latency. All other RDS engines have a limit of 16 Tib maximum DB size asynchronous replication typically takes second. 
-	Amazon Aurora Global Database allow to span multiple AWS regions.
-	Amazon Dynamo DB is fully managed NoSQL (schema-less) database service. Provides two read models: eventually consistent reads (Default) and strongly consistent read.
-	Amazon Redshift is a relational database service used for analytics.
-	 Redshift ,EFS and EBS are not valid options for storing Cloudwatch log files. Options for storing log files : CloudWatch logs, centralized logging system (splunk), custom script and store on S3.
-	AWS CodeStar enables you to quickly develop, build and deploy applications on AWS.
-	Amazon Neptune is a new product that offers a fully-managed Graph database.
-	Using Redis AUTH command can improve data security by requiring the user to enter a password before they are granted precision to execute 
Redis commands on a password-protected Redis server. You cannot use MFA with ElasticCache.
-	Classic Load Balancer supports health checks on HTTPS, HTTP,TCP and SSL.
-	Application Load Balancer supports HTTPS and HTTP.
-	The AWS Simple AD is an Active Directory compatible directory service in cloud. It cannot be used to proxy authentication requests to the on-premise AD.
-	AD Connector is a directory gateway for redirecting directory requests to your on-premise AD . 
Ad connector is considered the best choice when you want to use an existing AD service with Aws services.
-	Launch template enable you to store launch parameters so that you don’t have specify them every time you launch the instance. When you launch an instance using launch template the Amazon EC2 console
-	Best practice AWS Active Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory  for more than 5000 users.
-	AWS Glue is an ETL service.
-	 Redshift Spectrum for the complex query.
-	You can throttle and monitor requests to protect your backend.
-	When creating a VPC peering connection with another account you need to enter the account ID and VPC ID from the other account.
-	By default Eth0 is the only ENI created with an EC2 instance when launched. You can add additional interfaces to EC2 instances.
Default interfaces are terminated with instance termination. Manually added interfaces are not terminated by default
- EBS Throughput Optimized HDD use case : Frequently accessed ,throughput intensive workload with large data set 
(such as Map Reduce,Kafka,log processing, data warehouses,ETL). SSD option more expensive.
- S3 pre-signed URLS can be used to provide temporary access to specific object to those who do not have AWS credential.
- For DynamoDB default evantaul consistency.This may result in stale data being returned in some cases.
You can request strongly consistent ready by using SDK parameter.You cannot disable eventual consistency, it is default for all tables.
- Proxy protocol for TCP/SSL carries the source (client) IP/port information
- X-forwarded-for for HTTP/HTTPS carries the source IP/port information
- The new Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) feature automates the creation, retention,
and deletion of EBS snapshots but not the individual files within an EBS volume.
- You cannot use a resource-based ACL with IAM policy as this configuration does not support conditional statements.
- DynamoDB is more effective for heavy workloads.
- DynamoDD pricing is baed on throughput(read/write) regardless of whether you use it or not.
- When the launch configuration is created from the CLI detailed monitoring of EC2 instances is enabled by default
- Basic monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the console.
- RedShift always keeps three copies of your data and provides continuous/incremental backups

- Structed data  Redshift
- Unstructed data EMR
- Redshift composed of leader node and compute node.(Leader nodes are free)
- Compute nodes can be On-demand or Reserved (NO Spot instance)
- Redshift support only single A-Z deployment.
- Redshift always store at least 3 copies of data.
- Redshift support automated backups of the data warehouse cluester with 1 day retention period 
by default. It can be extened max 35 days.Automated backup can be  disabled by setting retention period 0 days.
- RDS structured data and for OLTP and reporting.
- Redshift large volumes of structured data and existing BI tools.
- EMR is processing and transforming unstructed data
- Automated backup RDS, Amazon Redshift
- Can cache DynamoDB and RDS
- CloudTrail is enabled by default for newly created AWS account.
- When you create a trail in the AWS Management console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions by default.
- AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance and operational and risk for auditing of your 
AWS account.
- NAT instance must disable EC2 Flag: Source/Destination Check. In simple words , each EC2 instance either sends or receives 
internet traffic. It means that they can be source or destination. 
- NAT instace must have Elastic IP.
- NAT instance should be placed in public subnet.
