-> Cold HDD is used for throughput-oriented storage.It is applicable for infrequently access data. It is not used for boot volume.
This is the lowest cost HDD volume type. 
-> Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) Data warehouses and log-processing. Not use for boot volume.
-> You can use a single ALB and bind multiple SSL certificates to the same listener.
-> The ALB supports IP address as a target.
-> The CLB does not support IP addresses as targets.
-> You can enable access logs on the ALB and this will provide the information required including requester, IP, and request type.

-> An Alias record can be used for resolving apex or naked domain names (e.g. example.com).
-> Amazon RedShift Enhanced VPC routing forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between clusters and data repositories through a VPC.
-> RPO (Recovery Point Objective) : the acceptable data loss.
-> RTO (Recovery Time Objective)  : the time in future that your application can be live.
-> S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost of all S3 storage methods. Data can be restored in 12 hours.
-> It is a best practice is to deploy Linux bastion hosts in two AZs, use Auto Scaling (set to 1 to just replace)and
Elastic IP addresses.
