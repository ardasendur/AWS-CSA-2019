- If  I/O operations are large and sequential HDD.
- SSD small and random operation.
- HDD large and sequential.
- SSD large database , HDD big data , data warehouse and log processing.
- Reserved instance provide you crucial discount up to 75% compared with On-Demand instace pricing.
- Flexibility to change families ,Os type and tenancies  when you are using Convertible RI.
- You can sell your unsude RI in RI Marketplace.
- only Convertable Reserved Instances can be exchanged for other Convertiable RI.
- Use signed cookies : 
   - You want to provide access to multiple restricted files for example: all of the files for a video in HLS format. 
   - You dont want to change your current url 
 - Signed url is appropriate for individual file
 - In  Amazon Redshift, you use workload management (WLM) to define number of query queues that are available 
 and how queries are routed to those. WLM is part of parameter group configuration. 
 - AWS Budget set the custom budget that alert you when your costs or usage exceeed or forecasting your exceed. 
- Use budgets to manage your budgets for your account
- Cost exploler tracks and analyzes your AWS account.
- Low latency response to high traffic queries - Nosql
- HVM AMI is for enhanced networking and provide higher I/O performance.
-  web identity federation is primarily used to let users sign in via a well-known external identity provider (IdP), such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google. 
It does not utilize Active Directory.
-As a best practice, create a trail that applies to all regions in the AWS partition in which you are working. 
This is the default setting when you create a trail in the CloudTrail console.
- Redshift Spectrum is primarily used to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3, 
with no loading or ETL required.
- Direct connect enables you to establish a private and dedicated network connection between your network and VPC.
- VPN provides a cost-effective hybrid connection between from ypur VPC to your on-premises. It does not by passes the public internet.
AWS direct connect connection which has a direct and dedicated connection to ypur on-premises network.
- VPN allows you to connect your AWS resources to data center with IpSec and TLS tunnels.
 - If you require external signal(decider) or human intervention or you would like to launch child process that return 
 a result yo a parent  consider Amazon SWF.
 - In cases where your EC2 instance cannot be accessed form Interner check two things: 
     1-) Does it have public ip address or EIP?
     2-) Is the route table properly configured?
-  Amazon SQS is the best solution to avoid having lost messages.
- Cluster placement group for EC2 low -latency network.
- You are limited to running up to total of 20 on demand , 20 resvered and spot instance per region
- The largest object that can be uploaded in a single put is 5GB.
- Object size > 100 MB - multipart upload, and object size 0 to 5TB
-  Amazon S3 does not currently support Object Locking.
-Keep in mind that an EC2 instance has an underlying physical host computer. 
If the instance is stopped, AWS usually moves the instance to a new host computer
- Data retrieval for Glacier : retrieval policies and provisioned capacity.
- Provisioned Capacity ensures that retrival capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
-  Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5â€“12 hours. 
- Standard retrievalas for 3-5 hours.
- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and 
secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket.
- DDOs attacks mitigation tecniques:
   1- Use AWS shield(DDos protection service) and waf
   2- Setup alerts in Amazon Cloudwatch to look for high Network In and cpu utilization metrics.
   3- DB instances in private subnets.
   4- Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing both static and dynamic content.
- multiple elastic network interfaces (ENIs) to each EC2 instance to increase 
the network bandwidth is mainly done for performance improvement
- Lambda monitoring graph: Invocations,Duration,IteratorAge,DeadLetterErrors, Error count and success rate.
- by default, ASG is not enabled in DynamoDB table which is created using AWS CLI.
- Active-Active Failover (resources to be available the majority of the time)
- You are limited to running up to a total of 20 On-Demand instances across the instance family, purchasing 20 Reserved Instances,  
and requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit per region.
-  Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files.
- Read replica do not do  anything to upgrade or increase the read througput on the primary DB instance.
- Read replica increasing aggregate read throughput.
- If your VPC does not have sufficient ENIs or subnet IPs, your Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, 
and you will see an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types like EC2ThrottledException. 
- Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, 
and you will see an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types like EC2ThrottledException.
- Each subnet maps to  a single A-Z.
- Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with main table for the VPC.
- EC2 instance in a private sybnet can communicate with Internet not just EIP , but also public IP.
- RDS is just managed service and not fully managed.
- Reserved instances that applied to terminated instances are still billed.
